# Photo-Gallery

A photo gallery using HTML and CSS is a simple yet effective way to showcase images in a visually appealing format.
By using HTML to structure the gallery, each image can be organized in a grid layout, making it easy for users to browse. CSS brings the gallery to life with customizable styling, such as hover effects, spacing, and responsive adjustments for different screen sizes.
